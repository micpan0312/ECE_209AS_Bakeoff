# Abstract 
Senses vibration through a piezo disc and classifies each different input

# Scenario
1. Hooks up circuit and solders desired wires as shown below in the schematic

2. Measures piezo disc with laptop audio port
3. Performs a sound/frequency close to the piezo diso to have it receive vibration as input
4. Collects and trains model 
5. Users can save and load models with their desired name to perform classification
6. The classifier distinguishes and identifies different inputs
